Elm LiveCoding Demo
===================

This is a simple way to do livecoding using Elm (similar to Figwheel in Clojurescript). The livecoding script is in Go so make sure you have Golang installed before trying it!

Try it out:
```
$> git clone https://github.com/theproductiveprogrammer/015-ElmLive.git
$> cd 015-ElmLive
$> go get github.com/gorilla/websocket
$> cd examples/clock/
$> go run ../../elm-live.go clock.elm
```

Point your browser at localhost:8080 and you are ready to go!


Auto Save in Vim
----------------

If you are using vim and would like a faster cycle you can arrange for vim to autosave as you type by adding these commands:

set ut=250
au CursorHold <buffer> update
au CursorHoldI <buffer> update
