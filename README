Elm LiveCoding Demo
===================

This is a simple way to do livecoding using Elm (similar to Figwheel in Clojurescript). The livecoding script is in Go so make sure you have Golang installed before trying it!

Try it out:
```
$> git clone https://github.com/theproductiveprogrammer/015-ElmLive.git
$> cd 015-ElmLive
$> go get github.com/gorilla/websocket
$> cd examples/clock/
$> go run ../../elm-live.go clock.elm
```

Point your browser at localhost:8000 and your're ready to go!
